## Overview

### The Challenge

Embark on an exciting journey into the cosmos with the Space Tourism Website. Explore the wonders of space travel and book your next adventure among the stars.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My Process

### Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

You will find all the required assets in the `/design` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

### What I Learned

- Designing an immersive user interface for space tourism enthusiasts
- Implementing interactive features for booking and exploring space travel options
- Creating engaging visual elements to capture the excitement of space exploration

```js
const openMenu = document.querySelector(".open-menu");
const closeMenu = document.querySelector(".close-menu");
const menu = document.querySelector("header nav");
openMenu.addEventListener("click", () => {
  menu.classList.add("active");
});
closeMenu.addEventListener("click", () => {
  menu.classList.remove("active");
});
```

### Continued Development

- Integrating real-time booking and reservation systems for seamless user experience.
- Expanding content and features to provide more comprehensive information about space travel destinations and experiences.
- Enhancing performance and optimization for smoother navigation and faster loading times.

The continuously learning journey of a programmer never ends. This project made me realize that there are many concepts that I need to work upon including fundamentals like flex-box and its properties, to more complex concepts like working with fetch and async await in javascript. These areas are some that I think I need to work more upon in the upcoming future as they highlight some of the most significant regions of web development that are important for every developer to know of. 

These key points mentioned here will help me grow accountable and consistent towards improving at writing good quality code and be a successful full stack developer one day.
